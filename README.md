tf_tls
======================

A Terraform module which contains a number of common configurations for TLS certificates.

TLS Catalog
------------
- [docker](https://github.com/Capgemini/tf_tls/tree/master/docker)
    - TLS certs for Docker daemon and client
- [kubernetes](https://github.com/Capgemini/tf_tls/tree/master/kubernetes)
    - TLS certs for APIserver, worker and admin key


Usage
------

You can use these in your terraform template with the following steps.

1.) Adding a module resource to your template, e.g. `main.tf`

```
module "k8s_worker" {
  source                = "github.com/Capgemini/tf_tls/kubernetes/worker"
  ip_addresses          = "10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2" # IP addresses of instances to configure with certs
  ca_cert_pem           = "/ca/cert_pem" # CA cert PEM
  ca_private_key_pem    = "/ca/private_key" # CA private key
  worker_count          = 1 # number of worker instances
  validity_period_hours = "8760" #Â hours of cert validity
  early_renewal_hours"  = "720" # hours of cert renewal
  ssh_user              = "core" # ssh user for ip_addresses
  ssh_private_key"      = "/ssh/private_key" # ssh private key for ip_addresses
}
```
